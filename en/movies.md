> The novel was released in 1999 and later adapted into a film in 2004.
>> In the summer of 1993, both wizards and Muggles are warned about the escape of a dangerous prisoner, Sirius Black.

As a result, strict security measures are enforced at Hogwarts to protect Harry throughout the school year. Meanwhile, Harry meets his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, a former friend of his parents, with whom he forms a close bond. Harry frequently uses his father’s Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map to explore hidden parts of the castle and sneak into the nearby village of Hogsmeade, despite being forbidden to leave the school. At the end of the year, Sirius Black lures Harry, Ron, and Hermione outside the school and, with Lupin’s arrival, reveals the true reason for his escape: to find and kill Peter Pettigrew, a wizard who has been hiding for twelve years as Ron’s pet rat. According to Black, Pettigrew is the real traitor responsible for James and Lily Potter’s deaths. Before their deaths, they had made Sirius Black their best man and Harry’s godfather.

## Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire 🏆
>
> The novel was released in 2000 and later adapted into a film in 2005.
>> The Goblet of Fire, an impartial magical judge, selects the champions for the Triwizard Tournament. However, in an unprecedented event, it selects two champions for Hogwarts: Cedric Diggory and Harry Potter—despite Harry being too young to enter. The tournament consists of three dangerous tasks spread throughout the school year: retrieving a golden egg from a dragon, rescuing a loved one from the depths of the Black Lake, and navigating a perilous maze to reach the winner’s trophy. When Harry and Cedric grasp the trophy simultaneously, they are unexpectedly transported to Peter Pettigrew. Pettigrew murders Cedric and uses Harry’s blood to resurrect Voldemort, stripping Harry of the magical protection that had shielded him from the Dark Lord’s power. After a brief duel, Harry manages to escape by grabbing the trophy once more, which transports him back to Hogwarts. Convinced by Harry’s account, Dumbledore decides to revive the Order of the Phoenix, a secret resistance group that had fought Voldemort in the past. He calls upon its former members, including Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Severus Snape, Professor McGonagall, and the Weasley family.
