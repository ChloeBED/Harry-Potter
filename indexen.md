*But what is Harry Pot de Fleur uhâ€¦ Harry Potter?* ðŸ˜„
>
**Harry James Potter**, in full, is the main character of the **Harry Potter** book series written by author **J.K. Rowling**. The books were adapted into films starting in 2001. The seven-novel series follows the adventures of a young wizard named Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, led by Albus Dumbledore. The main storyline revolves around Harry's battle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard seeking immortality who once murdered the boyâ€™s parents. Leading his loyal followers, the Death Eaters, Voldemort has spent decades trying to achieve absolute power over both the wizarding world and Muggles (non-magical humans).

### Introduction to Hogwarts
>
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is an institution that trains young British witches and wizards in the art and practice of magic. It is located in Scotland.
Hogwarts is a large seven-story castle with numerous towers, countless staircases, and deep dungeons. The castle was built by Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.

>>**The Houses** 
>
Each year, new students are sorted into one of four houses during the Sorting Ceremony. The Sorting Hat determines which house they will belong to:

* **Gryffindor**, founded by Godric Gryffindor
* **Slytherin**, founded by Salazar Slytherin
* **Hufflepuff**, founded by Helga Hufflepuff
* **Ravenclaw**, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw
>
_They will remain in their house until the end of their studies._

>>**Subjects Taught**
>
All students must study seven core subjects: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy, and Herbology. First-year students must also take flying lessons (on broomsticks).
For their third year, students must choose at least two additional subjects from the following: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, and/or Care of Magical Creatures. Specialized subjects, such as Alchemy, are sometimes offered in the last two years if there is sufficient demand.

### Harry Potter Adaptations 
>
As mentioned earlier, the seven novels were adapted into films, but thatâ€™s not allâ€”the saga has grown into an entire universe.
In November 2021, the website WizardingWorld.com announced the production of a retrospective special titled Return to Hogwarts, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the franchiseâ€™s first film. On this occasion, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson returned to the Warner Bros. Studio Tour in London, along with many other actors and crew members, to reflect on the cultural phenomenon of Harry Potter and their filming memories.

>>**Television Series**
>
On April 12, 2023, HBO announced the production of a *Harry Potter* television series with a brand-new cast. The series is expected to span seven seasons (one per book), produced over a decade, with J.K. Rowling serving as an executive producer alongside her collaborators Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts.
In April 2023, David Heyman, the original producer of the film franchise, was in discussions to join the project. Five months later, his involvement was confirmed when he stated that he and his team had yet to find a screenwriter but hoped to "explore the books in more detail" this time.

>>**Theater**
>
A stage play titled *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* has been performed in two parts (each lasting 2 hours and 30 minutes) at the Palace Theatre in London since July 31, 2016. It was written by Jack Thorne and directed by John Tiffany, in collaboration with J.K. Rowling. The script was published the same day in the UK and later, on October 14, in France.
The London production was well received due to Tiffanyâ€™s meticulous direction and the high-budget set design, which includes moving staircases, talking portraits, and more. However, the playâ€™s script has often been criticized as resembling "fanfiction" due to its numerous inconsistencies and "overly sentimental dialogue" compared to J.K. Rowlingâ€™s original story.
